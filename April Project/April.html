      The violin is the soprano of the string family. The high register of the
      violin allows for cascading melodic lines that can supersede the other
      string instruments' register. The four strings that make up the violin are
      G-D-A-E

      The viola is the middle-child of the string family.

      <i>It looks like a violin but slightly bigger.</i>

      The viola has the capability to meld together the high register of the
      violin with the lower trembles of the cellos and basses. It has a thicker
      sound than the violin, and some almost prefer it's mellow middle-register
      timbre. The strings that make up the viola are the same as a cello:
      C-G-D-A

      The cello is said to have the closest timbre to the human voice. Because
      of its popularity, there is a lot of repertoire written for the cello.
      <br />
      The strings that make up a cello are the same as viola C-G-D-A, but
      somehow the two instruments sound completely different. The sheer size of
      the cello allows for a bigger chamber of sound to cumulate from within.

      The string bass acts like the silent housekeeper working in the background
      in an orchestra. Really, you only notice it if someone messes up, but it
      makes a tremendous impact on the overall thickness and warmth of the
      sound. The bass' trembling resonance coats the cumulative sound and lays
      out the foundationi by playing the bass line.
      <br />
      The notes that make up a bass are E-A-D-G. Notice that it is the same
      notes but in opposite order from the violin.
